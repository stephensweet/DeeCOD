# DeeCOD
Genetic Circuit Optimized Designer
This tool with implementation of Cello v2, allows users to design genetic gates of their choice, or import their prexisting verilog gate file, then choose a bacterial chassis library(s).
Users have the ability to apply functions to the signal responses of the promoter inputs to maximize the responsivity of the genetic circuit.
Our output is then the optimized design given these parameters utilizing a modified simulated annealing via Cello v2.
